# Changelog

All notable changes to `@zakkster/lite-pick` are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.0.1] - 2026-09-22

M0 scaffold: the substrate seams only, no strategy yet (ROADMAP.md M0). This release
establishes the shared machinery every strategy (M1+) will ride and locks the ratified
ownership boundary in place before any `pick()` is written.

### Added

- `Pick.js` single-file ESM kernel with:
  - `VERSION` -- the source-of-truth version stamp (three-place sync with package.json + llms.txt).
  - `PICK_NONE` (-1) -- the fail-closed sentinel: no endpoint is ever a dead pick.
  - `Prng` -- an instance-local, deterministic xorshift32 (`next` / `nextBelow` / `reset`),
    so a strategy can draw on the hot path without `Math.random` and the balance
    benchmark stays reproducible.
  - `BalancerBase` -- the shared eligibility seam: a fixed-capacity pool over a SHARED,
    read-only `Uint8Array` eligibility view (written by `@zakkster/lite-di-health` /
    circuit breakers, read by `pick()`), an O(1) `live` count, `isEligible` / `setEligible`,
    and an abstract `pick()` that throws until a strategy overrides it.
- `Pick.d.ts` -- TypeScript declarations for the substrate surface.
- `llms.txt` -- LLM-oriented API + design summary.
- Test harness: `test/Base.test.js` (substrate boundary suite), `test/torture.mjs`
  (lite-leak retention + lite-gc-profiler 0 B/op on the substrate hot path),
  `test/perf/PerfGate.test.mjs` (lite-perf-gate `zgcSuite` hard gate + a `mustFail`
  teeth-check), `test/witness.mjs` (throughput flatness), `test/balance.mjs` (the
  random-foil baseline the strategy ceilings assert against from M1), and the
  `test/types` tsc surface check.
- `decisions/0001-selection-kernel-boundary.md` -- the five ratified ownership forks.
- `decisions/0002-anti-flapping.md` -- hysteresis/dwell/backoff on routing-state transitions.
- `RESEARCH.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`.

### Notes

- Zero runtime dependencies. ESM only. `sideEffects: false`. Node >= 18.
- Published metadata points at `PeshoVurtoleta/lite-pick`.
- Next: **M1 RoundRobin** (0.1.0) -- the first strategy, landing the throughput witness
  and the balance gate.
